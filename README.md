# FASTQ_Quality_Calc

<p>This script is designed for <b>FASTQ Illumina Deep Sequencing Files:</b> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format
Each FASTQ file contains multiple lines of sequence data and corresponding quaility value for each sequence.</p> 

<h4>What is Quality</h4>
<p>Quality is the probability that the base is incorrect. It is given in ASCII characters from ascii 33 to 126 (http://ascii.cl/). The exclamation mark "!" representes the lowest quality while the tilde "~" is the highest quality. This script assigns a number to each quality score, 0 being the lowest quality score and 93 being the highest quailty score. This follows the Sanger format of a Phred quality score</p>
<h3>The Script Returns</h3>
<h4>For each Read</h4>
<ul>
<li>Record Name</li>
<li>Total Quality Score for the Read</li>
<li>Percent of Total Possible Quality</li>
<li>ASCII Score</li>
<li>Total Number of Bases</li>
</ul>

<h4>For all Reads</h4>

<ul>
<li>Total Reads in File</li>
<li>Average Perent of Total Possible Quality for Every Read</li>
</ul>

<h4>To use the script</h4>

<p>This script can work directly with files.fa files. To use this script drag and drop your file_path/file.fa into the console.</p>
